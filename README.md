# weather_dashboard
Developed a weather dashboard using Python's Flask, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, leveraging data from "weatherapi.com". The Flask backend renders a single template through one view, which accepts both "GET" and "POST" requests. A model is included to save user-defined locations.

The application uses two HTML templates: "layout.html" provides the basic structure, including the sidebar, while "index.html" extends the layout and displays the main content. JavaScript handles click events, fetches data from "weatherapi.com", updates HTML elements dynamically without page reloads, and saves locations via a POST request to the view. CSS and icons are employed to achieve a simple, responsive design.
